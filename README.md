# SQLFinalProject
Written in SQL, I architected a SQL Server database and wrote stored procedures to load test data and retrieve information about library patrons and the books they checked out at various library branches.  This included queries which pulled from multiple tables, sometimes requiring INNER JOINS and LEFT JOINS.

For example, this query retrieves information about the book and borrower for a book that is due "today" at a specific library branch.  The query uses an INNER JOIN as well as the GETDATE function.  <a href="https://github.com/pmangione/Tech-Academy-Projects/blob/master/SQLFinalProject/SQLProjectCodeSnippet.txt"> View the code snippet here. </a>
